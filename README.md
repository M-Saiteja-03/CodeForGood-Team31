This hackathon was a first for us in so many ways. For most of us, it was our first hackathon, certainly the first hackathon where we were collaborating not only with people not from our college but also pan-India!
Regardless of the outcome, we had an immense amount of fun and the learning curve was simply unparalleled. 


Our technical stack was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS for the front end, and Node.JS and MongoDB for the back-end
We first decided on the stacks for the back end in accordance with our competence. For the front end, then we were initially considering MERN stack but since quite a lot of people didnâ€™t know react we switched to EJS - this helped us in two ways - EJS follows nearly the same syntax as html AND it has reusable components like React.JS


### Future Scope
- [ ] Sorting the scores in descending order
- [ ] Uploading / Exporting reports provided by the team members
- [ ] Automate free trial process
- [ ] Diplaying the financial growth of startups via scientific charts
